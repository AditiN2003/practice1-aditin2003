```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = subset_gapMinder, aes(x = lifeExp, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = country))+
   labs(title = "Life Expectancy vs. GDP per capita by Country",
       x = "Life Expectancy",
       y = "GDP per capita") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#009E73")) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 120)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(100, 20000))
